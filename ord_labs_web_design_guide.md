## 🧠 Aesthetic Framework

### 1. Visual Style
| Element | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Typography** | Bold, expressive headings using *Poppins* or *Inter*. Maintain lowercase brand styling (`ordlabs`). Subheadings and body text use *Inter* or *Roboto* for legibility. |
| **Color Palette** | Follow brand colors:  
- Celtic Blue `#0668E2` – Primary Accent  
- Isabelline `#F4F3EE` – Background / Neutral  
- Eerie Black `#1B1C1C` – Text / Contrast  
- Dark Green `#012E2C` – Secondary Layer  
- Dark Orange `#F68E1E` – Supportive Accent |
| **Imagery** | Combine *illustrations + photography*. Use mockups, dynamic backgrounds, and gradient overlays to emphasize innovation. |
| **Shapes & Layouts** | Geometric compositions, asymmetrical grids, and curved section dividers add visual motion while maintaining structure. |

---

### 2. Layout & Composition
- Use **modular sections** for flexibility (Hero, Services, Projects, Contact, About).  
- Maintain **visual hierarchy**: headline → supporting text → CTA.  
- Prefer **grid layouts** with subtle deviations for organic flow.  
- Keep **ample whitespace** to balance visual intensity.

---

### 3. Motion & Interaction
- Apply **microinteractions** for feedback (hover, scroll, button press).  
- Integrate **scroll-based animations** (fade-in, parallax, slide transitions) but keep performance lightweight.  
- Use **scroll-triggered kinetic typography** in hero sections for expressive branding.  
- Maintain **<60 FPS performance** target for smooth transitions.  

---

### 4. Thematic Modes
Support both **Light** and **Dark** modes:
- Light: White or Isabelline base with Eerie Black text.  
- Dark: Eerie Black or Dark Green base with Celtic Blue highlights.  
- Maintain contrast ratios (WCAG AA or higher).  

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### Hero Section
- Large, confident typography (“Crafting Innovation, Empowering Businesses”).  
- Animated gradient background or parallax layers.  
- Subtle reveal animation for text & CTA.

### About Section
- Mix of profile photography and custom illustrations.  
- Use storytelling to highlight founder vision and brand journey.

### Services Section
- Grid or card-based layout with icons and hover effects.  
- Use Reseda Green or Celtic Blue highlights.

### Projects / Showcase
- Asymmetric grid or carousel to reflect creativity.  
- Hover-triggered previews, light parallax on images.  

### Contact Section
- Minimalist layout.  
- Keep interaction simple, focusing on email or contact form with strong visual CTA.

## ⚙️ Development Standards
| Category | Implementation Guideline |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Framework** | React + TailwindCSS preferred. Modular components. |
| **Animations** | Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth transitions. |
| **Performance** | Lazy-load media; optimize assets for <1.5s LCP. |
| **Accessibility** | Use semantic HTML, proper contrast, and keyboard navigability. |
| **Responsiveness** | Test breakpoints for 360px → 1920px. Maintain layout consistency. |
| **SEO / Metadata** | Include descriptive meta tags, OpenGraph data, and favicon branding. |

---

## 🎨 Visual Design Tips from Dribbble Insights
- **Blend bold typography + minimal layout** to achieve expressive yet professional appeal.
- **Use layered gradients** (Celtic Blue → Dark Green) to convey depth and dynamism.
- **Favor organic motion over flashy animations.** Subtle scroll or fade reveals feel modern.
- **Contrast-rich color pairs** (e.g., Blue over Black, Green over Beige) enhance sophistication.
- **Non-standard grids** can be used sparingly to create uniqueness — ensure readability.
- **Illustrations and custom icons** align with OrdLabs’ experimental identity.

---

## 📱 User Experience Goals
- **Frictionless navigation** – Users should find key info within 2 clicks.  
- **Trust and modernity** – Visual tone should communicate credibility.  
- **Retention** – Subtle animations and visual rhythm keep users engaged.  
- **Conversion focus** – Prominent CTAs: *Contact Us*, *Explore Projects*, *Join OrdLabs*.
